+ ->fullName added is added in Port.h
+ ->log4cxx
+ ->Add destructor to derived components

+ ->different type of ports can not be connected to the same channel
+ ->order of  port arguments (in,out)  (out,in) should work properly
    ->check pointers as tokens

TODO:
+->define pipeline classes (add run() method )
->stop token
->unit test library
->generic components (Adder<int> a template)  only valid for all ports being of the same token type

Composite is not an abstract class,but its inst. does not make sense.
User who wants to create a composite component should derive from
composite and create the assembly in its constructor.
